        A <term>linear equation</term> in the <m>n</m> variables
        (or <term>unknowns</term>)
        <m>x_1,x_2,\dots x_n</m> is an equation that can be written in the form
        <me>
          a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots a_nx_n=b
        </me>,
        where <m>a_1,\dots, a_n, b</m> are constants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The linear equation is called <term>homogenous</term> when <m>b=0</m>.

        Consider <m>\sqrt{3}x+\sin(5)=2z-e^4y</m>.
        This is a linear equation in the unknowns <m>x,y,z</m> as we can write it as <m>\sqrt{3}x+e^4y-2z=-\sin(5)</m>.
        Note that this is a <em>nonhomogenous</em> linear equation.

    Given a linear system we will seek to find the {set} <m>S</m> of
    <em>all</em> solutions to the system.
    As we will soon see, this set will take one of three qualitative forms:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>S</m> is empty; i.e., there are no solutions.
          We say the system is <term>inconsistent</term> in this case.
          Otherwise a system is called <term>consistent</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>S</m> contains a single element;
          i.e., there is exactly one solution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>S</m> contains infinitely many elements;
          i.e., there are infinitely solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <paragraphs>
    <title>Example 1</title>
    <p>
      : <m>\begin{linsys}{2} x\amp -\amp y\amp =\amp 0\\ x\amp -\amp y\amp =\amp 1\end{linsys}</m>
    </p>
  </paragraphs>
  <p>
    { The first equation says <m>x=y</m>.
    If this were true,
    the second equation would imply <m>0=1</m>, a contradiction.
    Thus there are no solutions.
    The set of solutions is <m>S=\{ \ \}=:\emptyset</m>, the empty set. }
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Example 2</em>:
    <m>\begin{linsys}{2} x\amp -\amp y\amp =\amp 0\\ x\amp +\amp y\amp =\amp 1\end{linsys}</m>
  </p>
  <p>
    { First equation says <m>x=y</m>.
    Then second equation says <m>2x=1</m>, <m>x=1/2</m>.
    Thus <m>(x,y)=(1/2,1/2)</m> is the unique solution,
    and <m>S=\{ (1/2,1/2)\}</m>.}
  </p>
  <paragraphs>
    <title>Example 3</title>
    <p>
      : <m>\begin{linsys}{2} x\amp -\amp y\amp =\amp 1\\ 2x\amp -\amp 2y\amp =\amp 2\end{linsys}</m>
    </p>
  </paragraphs>
  <p>
    { The second equation is just twice the first.
    So we need only find all solutions to <m>x-y=1</m>.
    Note that we can set <m>x=t</m> for <em>any</em>
    real number <m>t \in\R</m>.
    Solving for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>t</m> we get
    <m>(x,y)=(t,t-1)</m> for any <m>t\in\R</m>,
    and thus <m>S=\{(t,t-1)\colon t\in\R\}</m>, an infinite set!
    This is called a <em>parametric description</em> of <m>S</m>.
    Alternatively we can describe the infinite solutions with the
    <em>parametric equations</em> <m>x=t</m>,
    <m>y=t-1</m>, <m>t</m> any real number.}

        Q: why the funny formatting?
        A: we always associate the <m>j</m>-th variable with the <m>j</m> column of our equation array,
        for reasons that will become clear soon.
        <em>Mandate:</em> given some linear system,
        possibly expressed in a funky way,
        always convert it to this column-aligned format.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The triple (or <m>3</m>-tuple)
        <m>(x,y,z)=(5,2,5)</m> is NOT a solution to the system.
        It satisfies equation (1), but not equation (2) and not equation (3).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The triples <m>(x,y,z)=(4,3,2)</m> and
        <m>(x,y,z)=(0,-1,-2)</m> ARE solutions to this system.
        You can check that both triples solve equations (1), (2) and (3) of the system.

    The staircase pattern of System 2 allows us to easily solve by
    <q>backwards substitution</q>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Eq 3 tells us that <m>z=2</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Substitute <m>z=2</m> into Eq 2, and solve for <m>y</m> to get <m>y=4</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Substitute <m>y=4</m> and <m>z=2</m> into Eq 1 and solve for <m>x</m> to get <m>x=4</m>.
    We see that <m>(x,y,z)=(4,4,2)</m> is the only solution to System 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our method for solving a more complicated system,
    like System 1, will be to <em>transform</em>
    the system into a simpler one resembling System 2.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Key point:</em> in order for this method to work,
    we need to make sure that the transformed system has <em>EXACTLY</em>
    the same solutions as the original system!

    <title>Elementary row operations</title>
    <p>
      We will only allow the following types of transformations of a system,
      called <term>elementary row operations</term>.
      In what follows,
      let <m>e_i</m> stand for the <m>i</m>-th equation of the given system.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>Scalar mult.</title>
          <p>
            Multiply an equation by a <em>nonzero</em> number <m>c\ne 0</m>.
            That is, replace <m>e_i</m> with <m>c\cdot e_i</m> for <m>c\ne 0</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Swap</title>
          <p>
            Interchange the order of any two equations.
            That is, swap equations <m>e_i</m> and <m>e_j</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Addition</title>
          <p>
            Add a multiple of one row to another.
            That is, replace <m>e_i</m> with <m>e_i+ce_j</m> for some <m>c</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We must convince ourselves that applying any one of these operations to a single row of a system will produce a new system with <em>EXACTLY</em>
      the same set of solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is so,
      then by applying these operations in series we will be able to reduce a complicated system to a simpler system with the same set of solutions.

      We saw already that the second system has exactly one solution,
      namely the triple <m>(x,y,z)=(4,4,2)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since transforming a system by row operations preserves solutions,
      the first and second system have
      <em>exactly the same solutions</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus <m>(x,y,z)=(4,4,2)</m> is the only solution to the original system!

    Let's make official some concepts and claims of this lecture.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We say two systems of linear equations are
        <term>row equivalent</term>
        if the one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of row operations.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <theorem>
    <title>Row equivalence theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Row equivalent systems of linear equations have equal sets of solutions.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <paragraphs>
  <title>Augmented matrices</title>
  <p>
    The <sq>+</sq> and <sq>=</sq> symbols in systems of equations just get in the way when performing row operations.
    As such we will often replace a system with its
    <term>associated augmented matrix</term>
    and perform our row operations on this.
  </p>
  <paragraphs>
    <title>Example.</title>
